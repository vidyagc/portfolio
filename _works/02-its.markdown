    <div class="txt">Vidya was responsive and dedicated to developing a site that worked well for us as a relatively new nonprofit and could change with us as we grew. She was also willing to train staff, so that we could make changes as needed. I recommend Vidya to any nonprofit without hesitation.</div>

<h4>Client</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
<a href="https://www.inthestreets.org/" target="_blank">In the Streets</a> is a Washington D.C. based 501(c)(3) social services nonprofit. It assists communities affected by generational trauma - working to heal that trauma via physical and mental health resources that prepare community members to support their own neighborhoods. It's "building meaningful livelihoods" through mentoring, restorative yoga, and participatory action groups.

<h4>Services Provided</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
I became Web Administrator for In the Streets (<a href="https://www.inthestreets.org/" target="_blank">inthestreets.org/</a>) in June, 2021. I provided content strategy, web design, and web development services to launch a new site. In the summer of 2021, In the Streets was just getting off the ground and preparing for its first fundraising push in the fall (grants applications and private donations). This push was timed with a Washington Post Local Perspectives article on the organization. They wanted to have the new site ready to show their work and call for donations by the time the article came out. This proved to be the right approach as traffic to the site, and consequently donations, saw a huge spike after the Post article was published.

<h4>Services Outline</h4>

Below is an outline of the main elements of creating the new site, followed by a more in-depth discussion of specific development and design topics.
