    <div class="txt">Vidya transformed our website into an easy to navigate, aesthetically consistent site which functions for fundraising, recruiting and giving the public access to a lot of very detailed information about upcoming events, while also storing some organizational history in an easy to find/read format. Barebones is a collective of artists which leans toward lo-fi, analog, and manual, but we put on a very large event which requires an online presence to interact effectively with a lot of people. Our website had been built patchwork style rather than with full functionality and design in mind. We added things as we needed them and relied on some beautiful photos for any aesthetic value. Vidya's redesign reflects the values and aesthetics of the organization while taking advantage of what a website can do for an arts organization.</div>

<h4>Client</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
<a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/" target="_blank">BareBones Productions</a> (AKA BareBones Puppet Theatre) is a Minneapolis-based 501(c)(3) performing arts nonprofit. It operates as a collective of visual and performing artists that produce outdoor installations and spectacle performances. Its mission is, in part, "[t]o bring art into community and community into art." Correspondingly, BareBones relies largely on volunteers for its yearly operations and to produce its premiere event, the Annual Halloween Extravaganza. Its website and social media are imperative to building and sustaining this community support.
</div>

<h4>Services Provided</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
I became Web Administrator for BareBones Puppet Theatre (<a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/" target="_blank">barebonespuppets.org</a>) in July, 2021. I provided the following services: content strategy, web design, and web development. Upon first reviewing their existing site, I identified many opportunities for improving engagement, including but not limited to: responsive (e.g. mobile) design, content refresh (text and images), new landing pages, call to action prompts, updated navigation structure, newsletter/mailing list signups, and web accessibility. These are listed in more detail in the "Services Outline" section below.
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
I assessed what was needed to show visitors the best of what BareBones does and promote public support/engagement. All together, these updates constituted a full redesign of the site. The bulk of the changes were done and made live incrementally, between August and early October, 2021. Due to time constraints, updates to <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/halloweens-past/" target="_blank">Past Show pages</a> were held off until after fall 2022: show pages for 2020 and prior will be redesigned.    
</div>

<h4>Services Outline</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
Below is an outline of the redesign's main elements, followed by a more in-depth discussion of specific topics.
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>Content Strategy</h5>
<ul>
<li>Audited all site content (text and images)</li>
<li>Generated a sitemap (a list of all the pages on the site and how they relate to each other)</li>

</ul>   
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">

<li>Restructured main navigation for clearer navigating experience and consistency</li>
<li>Designed new landing pages (e.g. dedicated pages for <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/donate/" target="_blank">donation</a>, <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/join-us/" target="_blank">community</a>, <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/jobs/" target="_blank">jobs</a>, <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/newsletter-signup/" target="_blank">newsletter signup</a>, and <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/press/" target="_blank">press</a>)</li>
<li>Incorporated CTA (call to action) prompts throughout the site, in areas targeted for various goals (e.g. donation and volunteering)</li>
<li>Added newsletter signup prompts and CTAs throughout the site (in areas targeted for that engagement)</li>

<li>Enhanced/corrected event images in Photoshop</li>
<li>Updated the header logo in Photoshop (tagline text only) to match site font and color palette</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>Development</h5>
The BareBones site was already on WordPress, and I stayed with the existing CMS and page builder for the refresh. One reason for this included the ease of use of the page builder for other users. It allowed me to make sections that are easily editable, so BareBones members would not have to be totally reliant on the web admin for modifying content.
<div style="margin-bottom:.25cm"></div>
<ul>
<li>Technologies used: WordPress, WP Beaver Builder, HTML/CSS, Photoshop</li>
<li>Built new pages and sections</li>
<li>Implemented custom styles for <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/community-calendar/" target="_blank">The Events Calendar</a> (overriding CSS files)</li>
<li>Responsive testing of entire site (including testing pages in non-device specific screen sizes)</li>
<li>Cross browser testing of entire site</li>
<li>Set up mailing lists in Mailchimp and Google reCAPTCHA for subscription form</li>
<li>Set default Open Graph image (for social sharing image previews)</li>
<li>Set individual Page SEO settings</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Key Components</h4>
<div style="margin-bottom:.50cm"></div>

<h5>Understand the Business</h5>
<div class="page-content-text">
There were several takeaways from this project. Chief among them was the importance of understanding an organization and its community when shaping its communication platform. I have worked with multiple arts nonprofits since 2016 in a variety of roles (including several years of volunteering with BareBones). In designing site sections and tailoring content, I was able to rely on an understanding of business priorities, organizational voice, and target audience interests.
</div>

<h5>Image and Video Content</h5>
<div class="page-content-text">
BareBones is a visual arts organization. Financial and other support for its work is built around the <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/halloween-show/" target="_blank">annual puppet spectacle</a>. Consequently, showcasing the best of the production's moments was a large part of content curation for the redesign. At the time, BareBones assets were in a number of places, and not easily searchable (that has since been resolved). Ultimately, I looked through thousands of photos from years of past shows to find images of the right quality (e.g. resolution) that showcased some of the most eye-catching moments. When called for, some images were also color corrected or otherwise enhanced in Photoshop.  
</div>  

<div class="page-content-text">
These photos were used across the site in banners/headers, half image components, and (most prominently) in galleries on the <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/" target="_blank">homepage</a> and <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/halloween-show/" target="_blank">Extravaganza page</a>. In addition to images, I collected video from one of BareBones past videographers. These were placed on Vimeo (there was an existing account), and also added to the <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/halloween-show/" target="_blank">Extravaganza page</a>. The artist statements from those pieces provided even more background for what the Extravaganza does.   
</div>  

<h4>Improved Engagement</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
Pinpointing the factors contributing to changes in web and social media engagement can be difficult - especially when there are several major events affecting engagement occurring around the same time. The majority of changes to the BareBones redesign were launched in mid Sept to early Oct, 2021 (this included <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/join-us/" target="_blank">Community</a> and <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/volunteer/" target="_blank">Volunteer</a> landing pages with mailing list signup info). Around this same time, BareBones was offering its <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/2021-show/" target="_blank">2021 production</a> (a new collaboration with another org, Festival de las Calaveras). The same season that we launched the redesign, we were also reaching out to new communities (predominantly Latinx) and offering an all new type of event. We received more donations than expected online and in-person at the parade and ceremony.   
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
There were a handful of volunteer inquiries (interest in participating in 2022) after the 2021 show. These came in during Nov-Dec 2021 and Jan 2022. In the spring and summer lead-up to the 2022 production, however, volunteer inquiries spiked significantly (many more inquiries than previous years), and they were coming into the email address listed on the new <a href="https://barebonespuppets.org/volunteer/" target="_blank">Volunteer</a> landing page. In fall of 2022, I'll be adding Google Analytics tracking to the site, so we can begin tracking this and other conversations.  
</div>

<h4><i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true" style="color:#dd6060; font-weight:bold;"></i> It Takes a Village</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
Small organizations like BareBones could not survive and thrive without community support. Outside of the dozens of volunteers who help create its annual show, it is volunteer board and committee members who keep the organization running the rest of the year. When I became Web Admin for BareBones in 2021, I was taking over from the previous Admin, Nick, who wanted to retire. My compensation structure was very different, but Nick set up and supported the site for over a decade at a practically pro bono level. He was basically doing it as a favor to the organization - as a supporter of the local theatre community. Nick is an artist himself and he was supporting fellow artists.  
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
Likewise, almost all of the beautiful photos on the site that show the Extravaganza's magic were taken by another community member, Max Haynes. Among other things, he was a photographer and fixture in the local art scene. Max photographed BareBones events that he wasn't even hired for and always made the photos easily available for anyone who wanted them. When I first started collecting images for the redesign, I reached out to him to let him know that I would make sure to credit his work on the site. His response, "I don't care about rights, or credit, have at it, make it work," and "I have probably already said that I capture pictures rather than shoot them. That way, I can release them back into the wild unharmed." It takes a village.
