description: a production quality SaaS app that allows users to create their own wikis
---

<h4>DESCRIPTION</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
A production quality SaaS application built on Ruby on Rails that allows users to create public and private markdown wikis and share them with other collaborators. A step-by-step overview of implementation will not be outlined below, but rather, discussion will focus on key components including, authentication, associations, file attachment, Markdown incorporation, Stripe integration, and scope/authorization. There will also be a cursory overview of decisions regarding user flow. The write-up assumes basic familiarity with the technology on the part of the reader. Environment setup is outlined in README in the GitHub repository, and is not covered here. TDD (Test-Driven Development) was not used for this app, but I have used it in others with the RSpec framework.
</div>

<h5>CODER COMMENT</h5>
<div class="page-content-text">
Collaborative and educational software is of particular interest to me. It goes without saying that information availability and sharing is the greatest social benefit the internet has offered, and I valued the opportunity to explore one corner of technologies used for these applications. Because of this app’s functionality, including multiple user roles and a subscription option, user flow took consideration. Determining paths and redirects after actions informed the app’s features.

<h4>Authentication</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
After creating the Rails app structure, I updated the <span class="terms">Gemfile</span> with, among other gems, <span class="terms">sqlite3</span> for the Development database and <span class="terms">pg</span>, Heroku Postgres database, for the Production environment. After generating the Welcome Controller and related views, authentication was added using <span class="terms">Devise</span>. This app only required one <span class="terms">Devise</span> model, <span class="terms">User</span>, and views, redirects, and error messages were customized. Customization included overriding the default <span class="terms">RegistrationsController</span> and a creating a <span class="terms">CustomFailure</span> class to redirect paths after failed authentications or account creation. A <span class="terms">_form.html.erb</span> partial with customized Devise forms was rendered on the Welcome page, and resource mapping was used in the <span class="terms">ApplicationController</span> to allow these forms to access Devise variables and methods. The full implementation of this customization is not covered here, but rather discussed in a separate blog entry, <a href="/2018/01/16/devise-customization" target="_blank">Rails - Devise Customization</a>.  
</div>

<div class="file-path">config/routes.rb</div>
{% highlight ruby %}
devise_for :users, controllers: { registrations: "registrations", passwords: "passwords", confirmations: "confirmations" }
{% endhighlight %}

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
Devise controller filters and helper methods are used in <span class="terms">application.html.erb</span> and throughout the templates and controllers. In <span class="terms">application.html.erb</span> in particular, <span class="terms">user_signed_in?</span> is used to display items in the sidebar.  
</div>

<div class="file-path">app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</div>
{% highlight erb %}
<% if user_signed_in? %>
    <%= link_to "My Wikis", users_show_path, :class => "list-group-item" %>
    <%= link_to "My Account", account_management_path, :class => "list-group-item" %>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h4>MODELS</h4>
<div style="margin-bottom:.75cm"></div>
<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>ASSOCIATIONS</h5>
Three models were generated for this app <span class="terms">User</span>, <span class="terms">Wiki</span> and <span class="terms">Collaborator</span>. The Rails generator was used, so the Ruby model classes and database migration files were created. <span class="terms">User</span> was discussed in Authentication, and I’ll refer you to the GitHub repo to review the models’ attributes. As to relationships, <span class="terms">User</span> and <span class="terms">Wiki</span> have <span class="terms">has_many</span> and <span class="terms">belongs_to</span> associations, as do <span class="terms">Wiki</span> and <span class="terms">Collaborator</span>. <span class="terms">Wiki</span> also has a destroy dependency with <span class="terms">Collaborator</span>. As a reminder (from the Features section), collaborators are users who have been given permission by the <span class="terms">Wiki</span> owner, <span class="terms">User</span>, to edit a private <span class="terms">Wiki</span>.
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
The <span class="terms">belongs_to</span> relationship between <span class="terms">Collaborator</span> and <span class="terms">Wiki</span> is relied on just once - the <span class="terms">wiki</span> method for <span class="terms">Collaborator</span> is used in the <span class="terms">_show.html.erb</span> partial in <span class="terms">views/collaborators</span>. The partial is rendered on the show view for users. The users show view first lists links to wikis the signed in user has created, and below that, there are links to wikis on which the user is a collaborator.
</div>

<div class="file-path">app/views/collaborators/_show.html.erb</div>
{% highlight erb %}
<% collaborators.where(emailid: current_user.email).each do |collaborator| %>
    <%= link_to markdown(collaborator.wiki.title), wiki_path(collaborator.wiki.id) %>
<% end %>
{% endhighlight %}

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
Several options were considered for creating collaborators on wikis. One option was a Has Many Through (HMT) relationship with <span class="terms">User</span>. I decided not to create a HMT relationship with <span class="terms">User</span> for several reasons. Foremost, I wanted to easily add non-users as collaborators – once the non-user collaborator finally sets up a <span class="terms">User</span> account, the <span class="terms">Collaborator</span> email address would match the <span class="terms">User</span> account email address, and that <span class="terms">User</span> would then already have access to edit the private <span class="terms">Wiki</span>. A more efficient implementation of this may have been possible – e.g. one where fewer <span class="terms">ActiveRecord</span> objects are saved to the database (right now, multiple wikis can have collaborators with the same <span class="terms">emailid</span> key) – but the current means worked easily for what was needed.
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>VALIDATION</h5>
As previously alluded to, <span class="terms">Collaborator</span> objects, unlike <span class="terms">User</span> are not unique by a primary key. Instead, <span class="terms">Collaborator</span> has a unique relationship based on its foreign key, <span class="terms">wiki_id</span>. The <span class="terms">Collaborator</span> model’s validations, ensure that a <span class="terms">Wiki</span> cannot have more than one <span class="terms">Collaborator</span> with the same email address.  
</div>

<div class="file-path">app/models/collaborator.rb</div>
{% highlight ruby %}
validates :emailid, uniqueness: { scope: :wiki_id, :message => "The user you entered is already a collaborator on this wiki." }
validates_format_of :emailid, { :with => /\A([^@\s]+)@((?:[-a-z0-9]+\.)+[a-z]{2,})\Z/i, :on => :create, :message => "This is not a valid email address." }
{% endhighlight %}

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h4>WIKI FEATURES</h4>
<div style="margin-bottom:.75cm"></div>
<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>IMAGES</h5>
<span class="terms">Paperclip</span> was used for file attachment to wikis. The <span class="terms">Paperclip</span> helper was used to add the image database fields to the existing <span class="terms">Wiki</span> model. The <span class="terms">has_attached_file</span> method and a security validation are added to the <span class="terms">Wiki</span> model class. The <span class="terms">styles</span> hash just has two image sizes specified.   
</div>

<div class="file-path">app/models/wiki.rb</div>
{% highlight ruby %}
has_attached_file :image, styles: { medium: "300x300>", thumb: "150x150#" } #, default_url: "/images/:style/missing.png"
validates_attachment_content_type :image, content_type: /\Aimage\/.*\z/
{% endhighlight %}

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
The image is attached (new or updated) and removed on the wiki edit view. A couple removal methods were tried, and the one that was kept allows the user to select removal in conjunction with updating the other wiki attributes. This implementation uses a checkbox in the wiki update form. <span class="terms">remove_image</span> is a non-persistent field, and is used to flag removal of the attachment.
</div>

<div class="file-path">app/views/wikis/edit.html.erb</div>
{% highlight erb %}
<div class="form-group">  
    <% if @wiki.image.exists? %>
        <br>
        <%= f.check_box :remove_image %>
        <label for="remove_image", style="color: red;">Remove Image</label>
    <% end %>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
<span class="terms">attr_accessor</span> is used in the <span class="terms">Wiki</span> model class to make this instance variable editable and readable. Then a method reference callback is used to update the wiki’s <span class="terms">image</span> attribute based on the value (checkbox checked or not checked) of <span class="terms">remove_image</span>. <span class="terms">!image_updated_at_changed?</span> is used to determine if the user is trying to upload a new image while also checking <span class="terms">Remove Image</span>. In that case, <span class="terms">image</span> is not updated to <span class="terms">nil</span>.
</div>

<div class="file-path">app/models/wiki.rb</div>
{% highlight ruby %}
attr_accessor :remove_image
before_save :delete_image
...
private

def delete_image
    if self.remove_image =="1" && !image_updated_at_changed?
        self.image = nil
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<div style="margin-bottom:.75cm"></div>

<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>MARKDOWN</h5>
<span class="terms">Redcarpet</span> was used for Markdown processing on <span class="terms">Wiki</span> content. A <span class="terms">markdown</span> helper method is defined in <span class="terms">application_helper.rb</span>. Two hashes are specified containing Markdown <span class="terms">options</span> and <span class="terms">extensions</span>. A <span class="terms">Redcarpet::Markdown</span> object is instantiated with these settings. An HTML renderer is also initialized. Finally, the markdown text passed into the method is rendered. The <span class="terms">markdown</span> method is called in three views, including <span class="terms">app/views/wikis/show.html.erb</span>.
</div>

<h4>ROLES</h4>
<div style="margin-bottom:.75cm"></div>
<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>UPGRADING AN ACCOUNT</h5>
One of Wikit’s features includes a user account being upgraded from the Standard (default) to a Premium account. An upgraded account allows the user to create private wikis. Account status is assigned in the <span class="terms">role</span> attribute of <span class="terms">User</span>. <span class="terms">role</span> is set to ‘standard’ upon object instantiation, using the <span class="terms">after_initialize</span> callback.
</div>

<div class="file-path">app/models/user.rb</div>
{% highlight ruby %}
after_initialize :init

def init
    self.role  ||= 'standard'
end
{% endhighlight %}

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
To upgrade an account, and change <span class="terms">role</span> from ‘standard’ to ‘premium’, a user makes a payment via <span class="terms">Stripe</span>. The user can also downgrade a Premium account back to Standard. Integration was done using the <span class="terms">Stripe</span> gem. Per Stripe’s prescribed pattern, after configuration with the initialization file, I generated a <span class="terms">ChargesController</span> with <span class="terms">new</span> and <span class="terms">create</span> actions. <span class="terms">customer</span> and <span class="terms">charge</span> objects in the <span class="terms">ChargesController</span>.  The <span class="terms">new</span> and <span class="terms">create</span> actions are standard for <span class="terms">Stripe</span>. A <span class="terms">Customer</span> is created as opposed to a <span class="terms">Charge</span>, so the card is available later for subscription charging.
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
Error handling with <span class="terms">flash</span> alerts was included in the <span class="terms">new</span> and <span class="terms">destroy</span> methods. Additionally, a <span class="terms">User</span> class method, <span class="terms">update_role</span>, is called in <span class="terms">create</span> and <span class="terms">destroy</span> to update the <span class="terms">User</span> <span class="terms">role</span> attribute and utilize <span class="terms">customer.id</span>. <span class="terms">customer.id</span> is stored in the <span class="terms">User</span> <span class="terms">cid</span> attribute in the <span class="terms">create</span> method, and <span class="terms">current_user.cid</span> is used in <span class="terms">destroy</span> to retrieve the <span class="terms">customer</span> object to be deleted. This method also updates the <span class="terms">User</span> <span class="terms">role</span> attribute, which is used in scopes and authorization.
</div>

<div class="file-path">app/controllers/charges_controller.rb</div>
{% highlight ruby %}
def destroy
    if current_user.role == 'standard'
        flash[:alert] = "You already have a Standard account."
        redirect_to account_management_path
    else
        cu = Stripe::Customer.retrieve(current_user.cid)
        cu.delete
        current_user.update_role('standard', nil)
        flash[:notice] = "#{current_user.email}, your Premium account has been downgraded back to a Standard account."
        redirect_to account_management_path
    end
end
{% endhighlight %}

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
Finally, resource routing is used for the charges controller with the <span class="terms">only</span> option to specify creating only the <span class="terms">new</span> and <span class="terms">create</span> routes. I then use the <span class="terms">as</span> option to declare two custom routes for charges.
</div>

<div class="file-path">config/routes.rb</div>
{% highlight ruby %}
resources :charges, only: [:new, :create]

as :charge do  
    get 'account_management' => 'charges#account'
    delete 'downgrade' => 'charges#destroy', as: :destroy_charge
end
{% endhighlight %}

<div style="margin-bottom:.75cm"></div>

<h5>SCOPE AND FILTERS</h5>
<div class="page-content-text">
With three user roles (Standard, Premium, and Admin) and access for non-signed in visitors, <span class="terms">Pundit</span> was used to restrict wiki access based on <span class="terms">User</span> roles. The Admin role was not discussed previously, as it is not available via the app’s user functions (sign up, or upgrade). <span class="terms">scope</span> is used to restrict which wikis appear on the index page. An inner <span class="terms">scope</span> class is added to <span class="terms">wiki_policy.rb</span> to do this. The <span class="terms">policy_scope</span> method is then used in the <span class="terms">index</span> action in <span class="terms">WikisController</span> to return the array to be iterated over.
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
<span class="terms">policy_scope</span> was not used in views. The retrieval of appropriate objects there was done via the <span class="terms">has_many</span> or <span class="terms">belongs_to</span> associations between models. Also, instead of Pundit’s <span class="terms">authorize</span> method, <span class="terms">before_action</span> filters are used to halt the request cycle. Devise’s <span class="terms">authenticate_user</span> method is used for the <span class="terms">new</span> and <span class="terms">create</span> actions. The <span class="terms">check_permission</span> method is used for all others. This implementation seemed more efficient than using <span class="terms">authorize</span> in <span class="terms">Pundit</span>, but the code could perhaps be refactored to use <span class="terms">authorize</span>.
</div>

<div class="file-path">app/controllers/wikis_controller.rb</div>
{% highlight ruby %}
before_action :authenticate_user!, only: [:new, :create]
before_action :check_permission, except: [:index, :new, :create]
...
def check_permission
    @wiki = Wiki.find(params[:id])
    if current_user
        if not (@wiki.private == false || @wiki.user_id == current_user.id || current_user.role == 'admin' || @wiki.collaborators.where(emailid: current_user.email).length == 1)
            redirect_to root_url, :flash => { :alert => "You do not have access to this wiki" }
        end
    else
        if not (@wiki.private == false)
            redirect_to root_url, :flash => { :alert => "You do not have access to this wiki" }
        end
    end
end

<h4>RESPONSIVE DESIGN</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
Responsive design was employed in this app, particularly for navigation, but also for view layouts. This is discussed in <a href="/2018/01/20/responsive-design/">Responsive Design</a>
</div>
