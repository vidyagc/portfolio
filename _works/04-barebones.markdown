<h4>CLIENT</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
BareBones Productions is a Minneapolis-based 501(c)(3) performing arts non-profit. It operates as a collective of visual and performing artists that produce outdoor installations and spectacle performances. Its mission is, in part, " [t]o bring art into community and community into art." Correspondingly, BareBones relies largely on volunteers for its yearly operations and to produce its premiere event, the Annual Halloween Extravaganza. Its website and social media are imperative to building and sustaining this community support.

<h4>SERVICES PROVIDED</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
I became Wed Administrator for BareBones Productions in July, 2021. I provided the following services: content strategy, web design, and web development. Upon first reviewing the site, I identified many opportunities for improving engagement, including but not limited to: responsive (e.g. mobile) design, content refresh (text and images), new landing pages, call to action prompts, updated navigation structure, newsletter/mailing list signups, and web accessibility. I assessed what was needed to show visitors the best of what BareBones does and promote public support/engagement. All together, these updates constituted a full redesign of the site. Changes were done and made live incrementally, between August and early October, 2021. Due to time constraints, updates to Past Show pages were held off until after this fall. For now, the only past show section that is viewable is 2020, which will also be included in that redesign.

<h4>CASE STUDY (COMING SOON)</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
A more comprehensive case study of the redesign will be posted this fall. Below is a summary of some of its key elements.
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>CONTENT STRATEGY</h5>
<ul>
<li>Audited all site content (text and images)</li>
<li>Generated a sitemap (a list of all the pages on the site and how they relate to each other)</li>
<li>Defined site goals: what are the business objectives we want to achieve with the site?</li>
<li>Identified target audiences, based on audience values and interests</li>
<li>Wrote content for new sections and sourced new images for the entire site</li>
<li>Identified content cycle - off show and during show season messaging, and when each needed to be applied</li>
<li>Created mailing lists for volunteer interest and general newsletter</li>
</ul>   
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>DESIGN</h5>
<ul>
<li>Created a color palette. The colors were based around the logo and rooted in the theme of BareBones premiere event - an autumn ritual honoring the cycle of life)</li>
<li>Restructured main navigation</li>
<li>Designed new landing pages (e.g. dedicated pages for donation, community, jobs, newsletter signup, and press)</li>
<li>Incorporated CTA (call to action) prompts throughout the site, in areas targeted for that engagement, for various goals (e.g. donation and volunteering)</li>
<li>Added newsletter signup prompts and CTAs throughout the site (in areas targeted for that engagement)</li>
<li>Designed mobile layouts and tablet size layouts for all pages</li>
<li>Designed mobile menu</li>
<li>Restyled/customized The Events Calendar</li>
<li>Enhanced/corrected event images in Photoshop, to make them look better on the site
</ul>
</div>

<div class="page-content-text">
<h5>DEVELOPMENT</h5>
The BareBones site was already on WordPress, and I stayed with the existing CMS and page builder for the refresh. One reason for this included the ease of use of the page builder for other users. It allowed me to make sections that are easily editable, so BareBones members would not have to be totally reliant on the web admin for modifying content.
<ul>
<li>Technologies used: WordPress, WP Builder Beaver Builder, HTML/CSS, Photoshop</li>
<li>Built new pages and sections</li>
<li>Implemented custom styles for The Events Calendar (overriding CSS files)</li>
<li>Responsive testing of entire site (including testing pages in non-device specific screen sizes)</li>
<li>Cross browser testing of entire site</li>
<li>Set up mailing lists in Mailchimp and Google reCAPTCHA for subscription form</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h4>
<div class="page-content-text">
There were several key takeaways from this project. Chief among them was the importance of understanding an organization and its community when shaping its communication platform. I have worked with multiple arts nonprofits since 2016 in a variety of roles (including several years of volunteering with BareBones). In tailoring content and designing site sections, I was able to rely on an understanding of business priorities, organizational voice, and target audience interests.
